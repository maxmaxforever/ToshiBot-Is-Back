# ToshiBot-Is-Back

Before you use toshibot read the Terms of service in discord (it's universal with any toshinou bot to be honest) Discord - https://discord.gg/z4rW6DR Have any suggestions? or know any fixes to some issues? leave them in "Issues"
#ToshiBot
A cheat/tool/bot/whatever for a browser flash game named DarkOrbit. It does some pretty neat stuff and is still under heavy development. The tool was originally created by freshek, but has been modified and updated by a lot of different people since freshek abandoned it. There's still a HIGH RISK OF BAN, as with any other bot (vertex, golem, etc) and i don't recommend you using it on an account you don't want to lose.

How to install/use? EN guide: https://youtu.be/sZOrfItRd2w ES guide: https://youtu.be/4kp8v413634

Chrome/Chromium/Opera Download and extract it Open any web proxy and locate the options Enable HTTPS decryption (you maybe have to trust the certification and restart the proxy) Install the addon through chrome://extensions Use any web proxy to replace the main.swf and preloader.swf Enjoy!


Issues : If the tool doesn't work, try to use Private mode/Incognito. Other situations should be reported in issues (game updates are fine there too).

Credits : Tanoshiizo for permission to continue Ultra! and Freshek for giving us toshinou opensource!
